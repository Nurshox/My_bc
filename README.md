## Task
this project was given to learn, understand and use the shunting yard algorithm 
which divides digits and operators and then collect in postfix expression

## Description
i devided everything into small functions, at first my programs checks for errors 
before allocating meory so there is no memory leak, then there goes shunting yard algorithm 
which converts and saves the expression into struct so after i use it to make calculations in other function

## Installation
as we work on low level programming language you will need to use gnu compiler

## Usage
[program_name] [expression_to_calculate]
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
